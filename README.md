# intel_bot
this is threat inteligence project
The Scope of this project is to help users and security operators with one of the most important responsibilities we have in cyber: to stay updated on the new trends and latest news. This is fundamental in order to avoid making the same mistakes as others or to be caught unprepared during an incident, or even notice a peculiarity that was not seen before in our organization. The thing is that it was probably noticed by someone else before in another organization, research lab, or even at home by someone doing some experiments. So, in order to help people and myself stay posted on the latest cyber news, I created a Python script that would gather information from the top 4 cyber feeds on the internet. Then it will parse the information in JSON format just like a SIEM would do and send it directly to any subscriber that has started a chat on Telegram with my bot using the Telegram bots API in a nice list of URLs every day.
